~~~~~Description~~~~~~~~~

Psy Fighter is a mix of a "point-and-shoot" and "hack-and-slash" action game.
The player controls a hero who faces an onslaught of enemies that scroll from right to left.
The player has access to 2 abilities that can be used to destroy enemies, and as one progresses
through the game, you will be given access to shop screen. There, the player can purchase
stat upgrades and ability upgrades.

For detailed control, ability, and enemy information, refer to the in-game help screen.


~~~~~Installation~~~~~~~~

For Windows:

1) Download Kivy for Python Module from: http://kivy.org/#download
2) Extract the folder to a convenient location
3) Open the folder you just extracted and locate kivy.bat in the main directory
4) To launch PsyFighter, drag and drop main.py onto kivy.bat
5) The game should then launch

1) From the Google Market, search for and download the Kivy Launcher app
2) Copy the PsyFighter directory into the internal storage of your android device
3) Place the folder under "/sdcard/kivy/"


~~~~PC_Controls~~~~~~~~~~~

Because PsyFighter is designed for Android devices, by default, keyboard controls are disabled.

The PC version is inteded for debugging and testing purposes only. However, if you wish to play
the PC version, special steps must be taken to enable keyboard controls each time the game
starts.

1) Once the game begins, after clicking "Start Game", click the bottom right of the screen
2) If done correctly, a small blue square should flash.
3) The keyboard controls should then be enabled
4) WASD can now be used to move the player

G - Enter "God Mode" state (very high HP, Psy, Gold, and regeneration)
I - Grants very high ability damage
O - Toggles ability upgrades
